# 👋 Hi, I’m Alireza Fazli

## 🌟 About Me
Hi there! I’m a curious and driven **Machine Learning enthusiast** with a deep interest in understanding how data shapes the world around us. Over time, I’ve been learning, experimenting, and building in the field of **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, and this GitHub page is where I share my journey—warts, (sometimes messy) experiments and all.  

I started out just tinkering with ML models, but now I’ve grown to appreciate the depth and complexity of the field. While I’m far from knowing it all, I love diving into challenging problems and learning something new every day.

## 🚀 What I’m Into
- 🧠 **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: I enjoy building and fine-tuning models to solve real-world problems. There’s something magical about making data "speak."
- 🐍 **Python & Tools**: From libraries like NumPy and pandas to frameworks like PyTorch, these are my everyday companions.
- 📊 **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Exploring and visualizing data with tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn is where a lot of my learning happens.

## 🏆 Projects I’ve Worked On
Here are a few projects I’ve worked on. They’re far from perfect, but they reflect the learning process I’ve been through:
- [**Image Classification with CNNs**](#): Built a Convolutional Neural Network for recognizing images—my first big step into deep learning.
- [**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**](#): Analyzed and visualized an interesting dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
- [**Custom ML Models**](#): Played around with predictive modeling and improved my understanding of hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.
- [**Speech-to-Text Pipeline**](#): Currently working on creating an ASR pipeline for audio data, focusing on preprocessing and model training.

## 💬 Why I’m Here
I’d love to collaborate with others on **machine learning**, **data science**, or just interesting tech challenges in general. If you’ve got an idea or project, let’s chat—I’m always happy to help or learn from others.
